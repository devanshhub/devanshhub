Led the end-to-end development of a full-stack e-commerce platform, from initial UI/UX design in Figma to final deployment. I built a secure Node.js/Express.js backend with RESTful APIs for user authentication (JWT), product management, and order processing. The frontend is a responsive and dynamic interface built with React and managed with Redux Toolkit for seamless state and shopping cart functionality.
